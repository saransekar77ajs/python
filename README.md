# Python Learning Journey: Assignments and Mini Projects

This repository contains my Python assignments and mini projects as part of my learning journey. The goal is to showcase my progress as I explore various Python concepts and enhance my problem-solving and coding skills.

## Contents

1. **Assignment 1: Basic fundamentals of python**  
   Learning Python syntax, understanding variables, and performing simple operations.

2. **Mini Project: BSA_AML (still working on it)**  
   A calculator program to practice functions and handle user inputs.

3. **Assignment 2: Loops and Conditionals**  
   Exercises to solidify loops (`for`, `while`) and decision-making statements.

4. **Mini Project: To-Do List Manager**  
   Demonstrates file handling for saving tasks and error handling for input validation.
